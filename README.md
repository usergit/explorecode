A simple application built to compare users repositories. For now it only works with github

## The tutorial
- to install
    - download to your local machine from the git repo
    - do npm install from the root directory, this will install all the required modules
- to run the app
    - make sure you are on the root directory
    - you need pm2 to run the servers
    - Type in “npm start” or “node main.js”
    - alternatively, If you don’t want pm2 to manage the process, and directly run the app, just type node app.js
    - open localhost:5000
